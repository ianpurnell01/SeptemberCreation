          <h2>FAQs About Ransomware</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>What is ransomware?</strong> <p>Ransomware is a type of malware that holds a victim’s sensitive data or device hostage, 
              threatening to keep it locked unless the victim pays a ransom to the attacker.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>How can I protect my business?</strong><p>Implement strong
              cybersecurity measures, regularly update software, and train
              employees on security best practices. Implement important training
              on how to detect social engineering techniques such as phishing.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>What should I do if I am attacked?</strong> <p>Do not
              immediately pay the ransom. Contact cybersecurity professionals
              and law enforcement for assistance.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>How does business size affect ransomware risk?<p></strong>
              Larger businesses may face higher demands due to perceived ability
              to pay, but all sizes are at risk.</p>
