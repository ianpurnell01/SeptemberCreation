# November Patch 0.9.2 (beta)

This month, we decided to enhance our tool even further by adding a risk score calculator. This risk score calculator takes numerous factors into account before computing how much their company is in danger. These factors are two things: security measures that the company has in place and the industry that they are in. 

Industry is important because some industries are going to be more risky by nature. Data that is held in healthcare or in the financial sector is going to be more risk-prone than others. We hope that adding this functionality in will make companies realize how prone they are to ransomware attacks, and make the changes necessary.

# October Patch 0.9.1 (beta)

Based on our creation last month, we decided to expand our tool to add a report, as well as open to an HTML file that has a few FAQs regarding ransomware.

Utilizing the data they gave us in last month's creation, we generate a report that consists of the provided information, as well as the tips we give them.

## Instructions:

To run the program, navigate to the folder where rw_estimator.py has been downloaded and run the rw_estimator.py file.

Then follow the on screen instructions, pressing enter after each line/prompt.

After completion, click enter. This should automatically download a report, as well as redirect you to the FAQ html file.

If this does not work, try running this line in your terminal:
python3 /Path/To/Your/file/rw_estimator.py

## Proof of Value:

Ransomware attacks have become increasingly sophisticated and frequent, as evidenced by recent trends in 2024. Reports indicate a dramatic rise in both the number and complexity of these attacks, with the average extortion demand exceeding $5.2 million per incident according to TRM Insights. The additional value we provide comes in the form of documentation, as well as providing educational resources. As we said before, there is no such thing as too much preperation in the face of ransomware.

# September Release 0.9 (beta)

## The Need:

Ransomware is becoming rapidly more prolific. Many companies simply don't know what to expect and have no idea how to prepare.

## The Purpose:

This tool is intended to give those companies a better idea of what the impact may be for their business based on its size.

## The Data:

Using data compiled and analyzed from various sources including Coveware, Sophos, CISA.gov, and Varonis, we have come up with average ransomware demand ranges for each business size category.

These are categorized largely by employee count and revenue.

### Small Business:

- 1 to 100 employees
- Revenue under $10 million

### Medium Business:

- 100 to 500 employees
- Revenue under $100 million

### Large Business:

- 500+ employees
- Revenue over $100 million

## Proof of Value:

For proof of this tool's value, look no further than the thousands of business that have been targeted by ransomware. There is no such thing as too much preparation when it comes to demands worth millions of dollars. Here are lists of companies that have benefited from ransomware preparation tools and services like our own:
